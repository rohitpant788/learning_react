Calling API -

The different ways to call an API - fetch, axios, and async/await.

The URL to be called is defined using a const URL.

Fetch is an inbuilt method in JavaScript that does not require installation or requiring anything.

The method used to call the API depends on whether you want to get or insert data, and the backend team will tell you what method to use.(GET,POST,PUT,DELETE)

When you call the API, it returns a promise.
.then acts like a promise, allowing you to wait for the API to confirm that the task is done and the data is available

The fetch function returns a promise, which resolves to the data returned by the server.

The dot then is used to handle the resolved promise and update the state with the retrieved data using this.setState.

A catch block can be used to handle errors, which can either update the state with an error message or print the error. 

This syntax can be used to handle asynchronous requests in a React application.
